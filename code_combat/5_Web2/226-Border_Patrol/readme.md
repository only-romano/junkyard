### _HINTS_

`border` is used to put a nice looking border around one's elements.

```css
div {
    border: 3px double purple;
}
```

The `border` shorthand property is made up of 3 sub-properties - `border-style`, `border-width` and `border-color`. These three control the shape, size, and color of borders you will put around your elements.

`border`s go around elements and separate content from outside elements.

```css
img {
    border-style: dotted;
    border-color: green;
    border-width: 2px;
}

div {
    border: 1px solid black;
}
```
