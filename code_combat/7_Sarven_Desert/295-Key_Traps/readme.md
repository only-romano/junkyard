### _HINTS_

_This level was created by player **Kevin Holland**. It is mega hard._

Welcome to The Trials of Mordrath, where you have the opportunity to prove your mettle in an invasion of no fewer than four ogre encampments!

Read hints to get more careful instructions.

This is a challenge level. So you can complete it many ways.

___

Start by reaching the Oasis of Marr. As soon as you begin, magic mushrooms will appear around it. (Hint: You can view a trial's name and information, just like a character's, by clicking it!) The mushrooms will completely heal you once you have collected them all. Afterwards, you will face an onslaught climaxing with the oasis' huge guardian!

Repeat this process for the next two trials, the Oasis of Anele and the Temple of Mirth.

If you survive, the Trial Master will heal you completely once again for your final test at the Monument to the Old Gods.

To those who dare to challenge the armies of the Oracle of Zha, Godspeed and good fortune--you will need it!
