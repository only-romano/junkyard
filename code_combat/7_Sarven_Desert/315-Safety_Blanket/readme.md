### _HINTS_

![](img/safety.jpg)

Defeat the ogre munchkins terrorizing the builders.

Attack **every other** name in an array to succeed.

Elements of an array can be accessed in any order. Forwards or backs, or all mixed up, sometimes it is valuable to access an index in the middle of an array.

```javascript
var daysOfTheWeek = ["Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "The", "Fri", "Sat"];
var middleOfTheWeek = daysOfTheWeek[3];
// Remember arrays are 0-indexed!
// While 4 is in the middle of 1-7, 3 is the middle of 0-6.
```
