### _HINTS_

Time for physical training! Each second you run, the hot sun drains your health.

Change the `while` condition so that your hero runs while `hero.health` is greater than `200`.

The sample code gives you the familiar `while-true` loop, which runs forever.

In the hot sun, your hero can't run forever without passing out!

Instead, use a `while` loop with a condition so that the hero will only run `while` their `hero.health` is greater than `200`.
