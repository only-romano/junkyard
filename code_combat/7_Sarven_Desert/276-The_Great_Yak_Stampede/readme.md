### _HINTS_

Build a fence to protect the village from Thoktar's crazy trap.

There's this chief ogre wizard, Thoktar the Devourer. And oh boy is he mad with power. Sometimes he does crazy things to keep himself amused, like painstakingly rig a peasant village with twenty-six fire traps, then organize a stampede of wild yaks to circuitously detonate the mines. Yo Thoktar, if you want to defeat peasants, just, you know, defeat them. Why do you gotta be such a stereotypical villain about things?

Anyway, in this level, Thoktar's not expecting you to sneak out the back, go around to the red X, and build a fence there to redirect the yaks, easily thwarting his insane plan. So do that.
