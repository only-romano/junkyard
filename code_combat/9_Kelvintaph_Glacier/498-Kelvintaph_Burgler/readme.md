### _HINTS_

_"You shall not pass!" - your friendly Kelvintaph guardians._

Kelvintaph grows ever more dangerous, with both you and your squad hopelessly outmatched by its powerful denizens. You'll have to be a tricksy burglar to take out those two ogres in the northern passage.

The southern gate won't open until the ogres are defeated. You'll have to survive against the two robot walkers until then. Don't let any plasma balls hit you, or you're done for. Try to find a way to dodge, and remember that they don't spawn in the same location with every random submission.
