// Welcome to Gridmancer!
// A relic of days long past, the puzzle returns!
// Your task is to collect all the coins.
// You are given special methods to help with hero task.
// hero.addRect(x, y, w, h) places a rectangle to collect coins.
// hero.removeRect(x, y) removes a previously added rectangle at the point.
// hero.navGrid is (basically) a 2-dimensional array containing "Coin" or "Wall"
// You must collect all coins under rectangles
// Rectangles cannot collide with themselves or walls
// You need to make at most 55 rectangles to beat hero level!

// See python solution
