### _HINTS_

"You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll brawl with each other like civilized people?"

Defeat the skeleton using a loop!

You can use the `findNearestEnemy` method to store the skeleton in a variable, then `attack` that variable. Put that in a loop, and your hero won't stop until the skeleton is defeated!

The skeleton has a very blunt sword, so it hardly does any damage. But given is gigantic size and strength, the sword alone is heavier than you are, so each time the skeleton hits you, you'll be knocked far into the air.
