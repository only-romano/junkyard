### _HINTS_

These magical bottles hold data.

First, you need to pick a `variable name` to label the bottle.

Than you `assign a value` to the bottle using the `=` operator.

```javascript
var myVariableName = "my string value";
```

We exaggerated slightly when we said you can name your variable anything you want... there actually are some rules to keep in mind.

A variable name must start with a letter or an `_` (underscore) character - it can't start with a number.

Some extra things to keep in mind:
+ variable names are case sensitive. So `myVariable` is different than `myvariable`
+ Some variable names are already reserved by the programming language. For example: `while`

Other things you might notice aren't really rules, but are common "conventions" that many programmers use, such as:

+ If a variable has multiple words, use capital letters or underscores to separate them, like `myAwesomeVariable` or `my_awesome_variable`
