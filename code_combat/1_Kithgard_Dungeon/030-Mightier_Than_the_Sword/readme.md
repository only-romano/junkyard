### _HINTS_

A _variable_ lets you hold on to a value for later. Some of those values are **strings** like names or phrases.

```javascript
var phrase = "This is a phrase";
hero.say(phrase);
```

Use variables to hold the secret passwords you need to open the library doors!

In this level, you need to open three magic doors to get out of the library.

To open each door, walk up to it and speak its secret password. But there's a twist: you need to use a _variable_ in your code when you speak to it!

A _variable_ is a way of holding on to a **value** so you can use it any time. The value of a variable can be a string, a number, or almost anything else.

Use the equals sign (`=`) to _set_ the value of a variable:

```javascript
var phrase = "This is a phrase";

```

Once it's set, you can use the variable anywhere in your code that you would use the value it holds.

```javascript
hero.say(phrase);  // Hero says "This is a phrase"
```

Note that a variable is _not_ a string, so you don't put quotes around it.
