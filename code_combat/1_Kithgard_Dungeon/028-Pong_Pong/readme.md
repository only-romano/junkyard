### _HINTS_

![](img/pongpong_.png)

Heads up, this is a **special Challenge Level**! You’ll be using Pender, the wizard, to complete this level. Don’t worry, your selected hero will still appear in other levels!

Solve this puzzle by **creatively** using all of the coding skills you’ve learned so far.

There is more than one way to complete this level; try to find a solution that uses **the fewest lines of code**.

You will complete a bonus goal for finding a better solution (in this case, one with fewer lines of code).

Take your time, experiment with different solutions, and don’t worry if it takes you a few tries to get it right —  programmers go through the trial and error process all the time!

Hey, you're reading the hints... congratulations! Reading documentation is an important skill for a good programmer.

As a reward, here's a hint!

If you want to use fewer lines, use `hero.say()` to say the string `"fetch"`.

Your wolf friend will then make sure that `"ball"` doesn't hit the ground, so your hero only has to worry about `"ball2"`!
