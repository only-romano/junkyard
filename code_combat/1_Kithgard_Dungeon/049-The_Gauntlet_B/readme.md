This level only needs **four** commands in a while-true loop.

With your powers of looping and variables, it should be no sweat to take down all these munchkins. In fact, with the **while-true loop**, you can do it in just five lines of code:

1. one to start the while-true loop,
2. one to move to where you can see an enemy,
3. one to store the nearest enemy into a variable,
4. and two to attack,
5. because munchkins take two hits with your current sword
