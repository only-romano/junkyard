### _HINTS_

Do you think that munchkins are weak? What if we spawn them again and again?

Using the `"defeat"` event, we can spawn two new munchkins each time a munchkin is defeated.

We can also count defeated ogres.

P.S.: Try to press the space button on your keyboard when many ogres are around your hero.

With `game.setActionFor`, you can set an event handler for all existing ogres, as well as any ogres spawned later.

For this level, you need to use the `"spawn"` and `"defeat"` events.
