### _HINTS_

In the fourth level of the Pac-Man arcade style game series, we will add power-ups that allow the hero to temporarily defeat enemies.

They will be time-limited power-ups which flips the "hunter-and-prey" mechanic for short time - the enemies will run from the player while the power-up is active.

This is the final step to prepare the game for testing, so it will be longer than the previous one. Use time-based functions, the `"collide"` and `"collect"` events and abstractions to make your code clearer.

Players don't like to run from enemies all time... they need some way to fight back!

It doesn't have to be a real fight. It could be power-ups limited by time, traps, tricky actions (like jumping on their heads) and so on.

Power-ups usually are time-limited, otherwise, they aren't power-ups but skill upgrades. Changing the power-up duration allows you to modify the difficulty of the game.
