### _HINTS_

Archers are powerful ranged units! Use them instead of soldiers to deal lots of damage.

Be careful, though, as archers don't have as much health as soldiers do!

When adding units to your level, remember there are different types of units which have different stats!

Archers are long-ranged damage dealers, but they have low health.

Soldiers are close-ranged tanky units, with lots of health.

In this level, compare the brawler's health between 3 soldiers and 1 archer, versus 1 soldier and 3 archers!
