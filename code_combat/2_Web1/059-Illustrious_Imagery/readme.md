### _HINTS_

`attributes` are pieces of information or data which is included inside of the HTML `tags` themselves. For example, `<img>` tags have a mandatory attribute called `src` which is the URL "source" for the image.

To add an `attribute` to an HTML tag, include it between the `<` and `>`. It must have a `=` and `"` surrounding the value assigned to that value. Not much different from creating a variable! But instead, you are setting the value for the `tag`.

To add an `attribute` include it between the `<` and `>`.
