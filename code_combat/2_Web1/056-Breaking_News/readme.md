### _HINTS_

HTML `tags` are a way of telling the computer how to display certain content. While it is helpful to view text on multiple lines, the computer doesn't know if there should be a break between two lines unless you tell it to.

```html
I'm on my own line.

i'm after the last sentence. :(
```

The `<br>` tag is the way you can do that! It will break text apart and put each part on it's own line.

```html
I'm on my own line.
<br>
i am now on my own line! :)
```
