### _HINTS_

The `<div>` tag creates a **division** of section.

`<div>` tags are a way of organizing information on your website. They are used to group certain elements, as well as add line-breaks between various parts of content.

Consider a blog (as that's what is being edited in this level,) with a bunch of blog posts.

The header itself is a `<div>`, the container of individual blog posts is a `<div>` and each individual blog post is it's own `<div>`. It helps seperate the each piece of content into it's own editable chunk.

We will demonstrate why this is important, later! 

**Example:**

```html
<div>
    <h2>Hello, world!</h2>
    <p>
        It is a beautiful day!
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Hot world...</h2>
    <p>
        It is miserable outside.
    </p>
</div>
```
