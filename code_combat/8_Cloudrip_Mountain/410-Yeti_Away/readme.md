### _HINTS_

Escape from the yeti, but be careful of ambushes.

Follow the peasant whose name starts with `"Mac"`.

There are three ways, but only one is safe. You should follow the right guide. You can easily recognize him by his name -- it starts with `"Mac"`.

Your task is to complete the function `startsWith`. This function checks if a `phrase` starts with a `word`. For example:

```
startsWith("Macleod", "Mac") => true
startsWith("Duncan", "Mac") => false
startsWith("AlMacDak", "Mac") => false
```

Compare letter by letter from the `word` and from the `phrase` with the same indexes. If any of pairs don't coincide, then return `false`. If all letters in pairs are equal pairwise, then return `true`.
