### _HINTS_

Those mushrooms are burning, but you need to collect 10 mushrooms for the medic students.

Your pet will help you and fetch potions, but don't take potions unless the medic name starts with `"Exp"`.

You've learnt how to implement `startsWith` function in previous levels.

If you have problems with this level, then try previous levels and return after refreshing your skills.
