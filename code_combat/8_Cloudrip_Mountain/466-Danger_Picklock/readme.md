### _HINTS_

![](img/dangerPicklock.jpg)

We must break that Door. It's really tough, but we have a bomb.

First, we need to charge the bomb until the optimal value (it's written on the bomb).

Use the predefined function `almostEqual` to compare area values.

___

The area of a circle can be calculated with this formula:

```
area = radius * radius * PI
```

where `PI` is a mathematical constant, the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, commonly approximated as 3.14159.

Also, don't forget to use `almostEqual` function to compare values in this level, because it's not a good idea to compare float numbers the direct way (`==`).
