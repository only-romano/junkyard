### _HINTS_

Write a function to return the strongest enemy, and command your archers to attack it!

Hushbaum will provide healing support throughout the battle.

Functions can _return_ a value.

In this level, you have `findStrongestTarget()` which should locate and return the enemy with the highest health.

When a function returns a value, you can assign that value to a variable when you call the function, like: `archerTarget = findStrongestTarget()` (this may vary a bit depending on the language you use, but the idea is the same).
