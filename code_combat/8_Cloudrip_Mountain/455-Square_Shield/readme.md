### _HINTS_

There are a lot of wild yetis and they are very agressive! Four paladins and a prayer can make the divine shield. Form a square with the paladins in the vertices and enemies will not pass.

Two paladins are ready, find the places for the other two.

___

To survive, you must assemble the Paladins into a square formation!

Since the Paladins will be making the corners of a square, consider these properties of a square:
1. The corners of a square share an x or y coordinate with an adjacent corner.
2. A square has equilateral (same length) sides.

To solve this level, move Vaelia and Illumina a `sideLength` away from each corner, but make sure they share a similar corner position (`x`).
