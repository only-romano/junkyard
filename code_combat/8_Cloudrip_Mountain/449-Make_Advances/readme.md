### _HINTS_

Prepare yourself for a challenge!

Guide the Raider Arryn through the long, dark dungeons!

It is your responsibility to protect her back using a lone peasant, so keep your eye out for ogres and write your code carefully.

___

Command Paladins to `"shield"` when a fireball gets too close.

Paladins can be `command`ed to `"shield"`.

Some important things to note:
+ `hero.findEnemyMissiles()` finds all damaging missiles that they can see.
+ Missiles will explode when they collide with a unit!
+ Shielding mitigates a certain % of incoming damage
+ Be sure to be shielding when the fireball gets too close, or they will take full damage!
