You need to know how to calculate a perimeter and an area of rectangles.

`perimeter = (width + height) * 2`

`area = width * height`

Perimeter and area are important concepts in Geometry. In everyday life you will often meet those terms, especially regarding rectangles.

1. **Rectangle** is a four-sided shape that is made up of two pairs of parallel lines and that has four right angles
2. **Perimeter** is a path that surrounds a two-dimensional shape.
3. **Area** is the region enclosed by the perimeter of a two-dimensional figure or shape.
