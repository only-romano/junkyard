### _HINTS_

Draw a **circle** and a **square** then draw whatever you like!

The sample code gives you functions for `drawCircle` and `drawSquare`.

To pass the level, you need to draw a size `10` circle at the coordinates given for `redX` and a size `10` square at the coordinates for `whiteX`.

After that, you can experiment with drawing other shapes if you like, or move on to the **Mountain Flower Grove** to practice your drawing skills!
