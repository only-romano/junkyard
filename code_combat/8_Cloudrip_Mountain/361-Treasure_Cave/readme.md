### _HINTS_

Blow up a `"fire-trap"` to distract a Yeti and gather coins!

Retreat to the camp after your pockets are full of currency!

In this level, any `"fire-trap"`s the hero builds will explode after `5 seconds`!

When the Yeti hears an explosion it will move to investigate, you should use that time to gather the coins! Be sure to run back to the camp afterwards.
