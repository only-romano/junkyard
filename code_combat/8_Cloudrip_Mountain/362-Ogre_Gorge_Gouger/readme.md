### _HINTS_

![](img/ogre_gorge-gouger.png)

Use `findItems()` for an array of all the coins. `findNearest(array)` to find the nearest element in array.

Remember how to construct object literals: `{"x": 16, "y": 38}`.

Use `findItems()` to find coins with advanced glasses. See if you can optimize your path to collect more than 60 coins before the ogres show up!

Use object literals like `{"x": 16, "y": 38}` to move to a specific spot, such as behind the fences.
