### _HINTS_

It was a bad idea to encircle the chosen One. He can use the Ancient Shout.

Be careful, the power of the shout should be equal the area of the circle.

In geometry, the area enclosed by a circle of radius `r` is `π*r*r`. Here the Greek letter `π` represents a constant, approximately equal to `3.14159`, which is equal to the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter.

```javascript
var area = Math.PI * radius * radius;
```
