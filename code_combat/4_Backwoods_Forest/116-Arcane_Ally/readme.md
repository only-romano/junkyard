### _HINTS_

Challenge level! If you can defeat this many ogre munchkins, you'll unlock few wizard specific levels where you can learn some their abilities.

Check you equipment and armor. You need something better than the bronze old set.

Make sure that you have enough armor to defeat the ogres. You will probably need more than 300 health to survive. If you don't have enough, come back later when you've earned more gems.

It's a straight-up brawl between you and the ogres, no tricks required, just sheer might.
