### _HINTS_

![](img/deja_brew.jpeg)

You can **concatenate** (combine) strings with other strings, or numbers:

```javascript
var numberOfPotions = 5;
hero.say("I have " + numberOfPotions + " potions.");
```

Use string concatenation to sing along with your friends!

Listen to what your friends around you are saying and say it back to them!

```javascript
hero.say(potionsOnTheWall + " potions of health!");
```

Remember that concatenation only adds two strings together.

```javascript
hero.say("Take " + numToTakeDown + " down, pass it around!");
```

Finally say the last verse of the song!

You can **concatenate** (combine) strings with other strings, or numbers:

```javascript
var numberOfPotions = 5;
hero.say("I have " + numberOfPotions + " potions.");
```

Use string concatenation to sing along with your friends! The song goes like this:

```
potionsOnTheWall + " potions of health on the wall!"
potionsOnTheWall + " potions of health!"
"Take " + numToTakeDown + " down, pass it around!"
potionsOnTheWall + " potions of health on the wall."
```
