### _HINTS_

When all else fails, use fire.

This is an extreme reaction time challenge level. You'll likely need flags, a quick hand, and nerves of steel to survive.

If you need a refresher on how to use flags to control your hero's movement, play the level Coinucopia, in the latter half of the forest.
