### _HINTS_

Our archers are ready to defend against most ogres, but they can't defeat the huge ogre `"brawler"`s. Against those big guys, we have artillery.

Ammunition is low, but it should be enough to stop all brawlers. Don't waste cannon shells against other ogres.

If an ogre is type `"brawler"` AND the distance to it is less than 50 meters, command the artillery to fire by saying `"Fire!"`.

You know how to use a logical AND operator from the previous levels. Also, you should know how to check an ogre's type and the distance to it.

Check each ogre's type AND distance before firing!
