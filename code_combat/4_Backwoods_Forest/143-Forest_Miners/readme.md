### _HINTS_

It's your job to make sure no ogres disturb these miners.

First, fill in the `checkEnemyOrSafe()` function. Only call the peasants if there were no ogres, because attacking an ogre will attract attention!

Then, look at the code that checks the top-right X mark, and do something similar to check the bottom-left X mark.

You've learned how to write and call functions with parameters in the previous levels. If you have problems with this level, you can return and repeat levels about functions to refresh your skills.
