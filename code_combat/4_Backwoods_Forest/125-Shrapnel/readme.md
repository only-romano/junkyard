### _HINTS_

In addition to thrown daggers, Rangers can also use thrown charges to deal area effect damage and take out packs of enemies. But you must be careful not to blow yourself up! So when using the weak charge, you must use `distanceTo` to make sure you are only throwing charges at enemies that are far enough away.

If you get stuck, review what you did in Swift Dagger, but instead of throwing daggers when they are nearby, throw charges when they are far away and attack when they are nearby.

After this level, you can use your Ranger to do most of the levels, but if you think a Warrior would be better for a particular level, you may want to switch back and forth.
