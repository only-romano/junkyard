### _HINTS_

In the next few levels, we're going to build a Pac-Man style arcade game.

The player's goal is to collect all the coins.

Ogres hunt for the player and can defeat them with one hit.

There will be some power ups which allow the player to defeat ogres (by running into them) for a short time.

Score is time based and reduces with each second that passes - so it's a race against time! The player can also increase the score by defeating ogres, and collecting coins and power ups.

In this level, we will start by building the maze, the hero and collectables.

We will use `"forest"` tiles in a grid for the maze, and `"mushrooms"`s for the powerups.

Use the keyboard or mouse for player control:
+ `W` -> up
+ `S` -> down
+ `A` -> left
+ `D` -> right
+ `mouse click` -> move to the point

The placing for so many objects could be boring. However, it's a part of Game Dev routine. Don't worry, you will learn how to automatize it in next courses. For the game, we've chosen to use a grid system for coins and forest tiles, because symmetry is simple and beautiful.

For your future projects, you can place tiles as you want and get interesting layouts. Level design is about creativity.
