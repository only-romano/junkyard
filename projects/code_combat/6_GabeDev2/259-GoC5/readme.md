### _HINTS_

In the final level of the Pac-man style arcade game series, we will balance the game.

The game logic is ready. In previous levels, we were using unbalanced game parameters like high hero speed to simplify the game testing in early stages.

However, the final version of the game should be balanced. If it's too easy, the players will be bored. If it's too hard, then they will be frustrated and give up quickly.

To simplify the balancing process we've moved all game parameters to the top of the code so you can see them in one place and quickly make changes.

Currently the game parameters are set for ultra-hard difficulty. Try to make it easier. Don't worry, there are no "ideal" parameters and no right answer.

You decide what parameters should be and how hard the game will be. Try to make it challenging, but fun!

Try to change parameters one by one instead changing all of them for each iteration. It's hard to understand the influence of game parameters when you change several simultaneously.

However sometimes game parameters have synergy and you can see results only when changing them together. There is no correct answer. Just test various sets of parameters and analyze the results.
