### _HINTS_

Find the correct chest by detecting an anomaly in Thoktar's name! The correct chest is the same index as "z".

Choose poorly, and the skeletons will claim their own prize!

Find the treasure chest which contains the treasure!

Thoktar's name holds the secret. Whichever index in Thoktar's name is `"z"`, is the index of chests that the player should approach.

Iterate over each element of a string with the following:

```javascript
var string = "Hello, world!";
for (var i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
    var letter = string[i];
    hero.say(letter);  // The hero will say each letter individually.
}
```

Use this knowledge to defeat Thoktar!
