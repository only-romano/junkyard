### _HINTS_

Ogre warlocks will appear if you lose a soldier!

Command injured soldiers to retreat if their health is under `100`!

This level is a lot like Timber Guard - but with a twist!

If your soldiers are defeated, an ogre warlock will take advantage and raise them from the afterlife to fight against you. Don't let that happen!

Remember, you can check your soldiers' health with `soldier.health` and `soldier.maxHealth`.
