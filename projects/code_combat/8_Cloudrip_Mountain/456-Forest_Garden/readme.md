### _HINTS_

![](img/forestGarden.jpg)

This forest would be perfect with a rectangle of flowers.

The rectangle should be perfect. One wrong step and Naria will be angry.

**Don't use _hard-coded_ coordinates (for ex, `moveXY(62, 60)`) because the size of the forest is random.**

Previous levels have covered this topic, so if you have problems, be sure to review past levels!

Also the properties of rectangles can be useful here:
1. The corners of a rectangles share an x or y coordinate with an adjacent corner.
2. Alternate sides are equal.
