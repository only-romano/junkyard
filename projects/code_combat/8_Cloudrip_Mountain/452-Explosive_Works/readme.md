### _HINTS_

You need to blow up this mountain to reveal the hidden entrance. Form a rectangle of mines with the given perimeter and calculate the area.

When you are ready just tell the area to the special operations archer.

___

You have learnt what you need for this level in the previous levels. If you have problems with this level, then try to go back and refresh your knowledge.

Just two formulas as a reminder:

`perimeter = (width + height) * 2`

Which is the same as:

`perimeter = width * 2 + height * 2`

And if you know the `perimeter`, and `height` or `width`, you can find the `width` or `height` by substituting the values.

`area = width * height`

Just a formula:

```
width = (perimeter - 2 * height) / 2
```
