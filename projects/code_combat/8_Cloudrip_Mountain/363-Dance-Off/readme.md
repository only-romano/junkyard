### _HINTS_

Keep up with your dance partner. `findNearest` of `findFriends` and stay in sync with their movement.

Find the distance between your hero and their partner and use that `offset` to move perfectly in sync with the rest of the dancers.

The goal is to stay close to the hero that you start nearest to.

First use `findFriends` to find your nearest friend, then calculate your position in relation to that friend.

Then, in a loop, `move()` in sync with your friend. If you stay in position relative to the other dancers, you'll succeed.
