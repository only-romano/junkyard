### _HINTS_

Put Pender Spellbane's talents to the test!

Run through a valley of yetis and ogres with `"haste"`! Be sure to use `resetCooldown` to ensure haste remains up!

Use `manaBlast` when reaching a roadblock to clear the ogres.

___

This level is intended for Pender Spellbane's particular talents.

Speed is key. You'll want to use a spell like `"haste"` or possibly `"shrink"` to increase your speed.

Those ogre scouts are braced together to block your path, so you should use something like `manaBlast()` to knock them out of your way.

Finally, you may find your speed running out before you reach the finish line. That's where `resetCooldown()` helps by allowing you to re-use your speed spell of choice.
