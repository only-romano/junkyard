### _HINTS_

Ogres think that the equestrian will lead you into the trap. But they don't know that he works for us.

The equestrian can't say where to go directly, that's why he uses whitespaces. Leading and trailing whitespaces are invisible in dialogue bubbles. Count them and use that number to find the safe passage.

You've learnt how to use the `str.trim()` method in previous levels. Don't forget that this method returns a copy of the string `str` with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

If you have problems with this level, then try previous levels and return after refreshing your skills.
