### _HINTS_

Soldiers should feel the distance on a battlefield. We are using the distance test to find clumsy soldiers.

They should move the whole time and keep the same distance to the hero. Say their name when you see someone breaks the circle.

___

A circle is a simple closed shape. It is the set of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre.

As you can see all soldiers are trying to keep the same distance from your hero. As the result, they form the circle and your hero is the centre of this circle. It's the most important property of circles because it defines their form.

Also, you've noticed that we don't compare distances directly like `distance1 == distance2`. We are using some `inaccuracy` to compare if they are "almost" equal. Otherwise, you can get wrong results because it's hard to compare non-integer numbers.
