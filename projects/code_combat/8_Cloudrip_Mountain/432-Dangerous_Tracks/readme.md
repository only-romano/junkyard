### _HINTS_

There are many entrances that lead into the village. Protect the village and mine all the entrances.

You have 80 seconds before an ogre hunter squad arrives.

Use `for`-loops to save time and make your code cleaner.

Remember how to advance over `for`-loop with numbers higher 1:

```javascript
for (var i = 25; i < 100; i += 5) {
    hero.moveXY(i, 50);  // Move from 25, 50 to 95, 50 with 5-unit steps.
}
```
