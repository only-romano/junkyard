### _HINTS_

Break apart vital parts of your code into functions.

Collect gold and summon soldiers while avoiding attacking ogres!

Functions are great for breaking up advanced behavior into smaller more **bite-sized** pieces.

In this level, you should collect coins, summon soldiers, and have all soldiers attack their nearest enemy. Each of those actions could be their own function!

Look at the example functions already written for you: `pickUpNearestCoin` and `commandSoldiers` and fill out your own: `summonSoldier` function.

Remember that after **defining** a function, you must **call** it! To **call** a function use `()` at the end of the function's name, like `commandSoldiers()`.
