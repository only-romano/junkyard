### _HINTS_

Wizards will help you with defeating the ogres, but each of them can cast a lightning bolt only once.

Shout (use upper-case) the names of the biggest ogres to target wizards.

You've learned how to use `toLowerCase` and `toUpperCase` methods in previous levels.

If you have problems with this level, then try previous levels and return after refreshing your skills.
