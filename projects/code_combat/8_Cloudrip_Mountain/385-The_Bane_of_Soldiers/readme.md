### _HINTS_

Send out a sacrificial lamb to blow up the Robobombs, one-by-one.

Be sure to retreat with the rest of the soldiers until it is their turn to make the sacrifice.

What kind of madman would leave four armed roboboms standing around!?

Robobombs, for the uninitiated, are suicidal death robots that have a large area of effect explosion radius. Once they get close enough: BOOM!

Command your soldiers wisely, to minimize the casualties.

Piece-meal feed your troops to the robots, one-by-one and command the others to run away from their attackers!

Some useful concepts to help with this level:

```javascript
// The order of the friends array won't change over timee.
var friends = hero.findFriends();
// The 0-th index is the first friend! This will be the same friend, until it dies...
var firstFriend = friends[0];
// Starting a for-loop at index 1 skips over the very first unit,
// which is busy making a very noble sacrifice.
for (var i = 1; i < friends.length; i++) {
    // Fine!
}
```
