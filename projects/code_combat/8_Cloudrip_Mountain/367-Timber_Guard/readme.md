### _HINTS_

![](img/timber-guard.png)

A `for` loop is similar to a `while` loop. There is more setup, but it can be used to accomplish the same thing.

This level introduces `for` loops. They can be quite different depending on the language you're using, so look at the comments in the level's default code for help.

Remember that you command your soldiers with `command(soldier, "attack", enemy)` or `command(soldier, "move", pos)`.

Your hero should stay behind and collect coins. If you try to fight the ogres personally, you may attract the attention of ogre assassins!
