### _HINTS_

Pick three directions to throw Arryn's Razordiscs to take care of the Ogre!

The first direction has been chosen for you, now pick the other two directions to throw razordiscs!

You'll need to throw three discs that will all hit the ogre at just about the same time to succeed at this level.

Throw one straight down (your position y - 5), one straight up (your position y + 5), and one straight left (your position x - 5).

The `wait()` is there so you do something while your `throw()` isn't ready, otherwise the game may think you are in an infinite loop.
