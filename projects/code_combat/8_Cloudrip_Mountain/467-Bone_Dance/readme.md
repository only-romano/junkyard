You have already learnt what you need to complete this level. If you have problems, then go back to the previous levels and refresh your knowledge.

Don't forget to use `almostEqual` function to compare numbers. It can help to avoid a problem with the comparison of float numbers.

Also if you forgot, then the formula of the circumference of the circle is:

```
C = 2 * PI * R
where R is the radius
PI is approximately 3.14
```
