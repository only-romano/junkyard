Match archers with their antipode (the enemy archer with the reversed named).

Once all the antipodes are defeated, defeat the warlock.

P.S.: The warlock looks peaceful, but he can feel any aggression.

This level is about reversing strings. Consider arrays and strings as equivalent, so think of each **character** in a _string_ as an **element** in an _array_.

Here is an algorithm to help get you started:
1. Create an empty string to store the reversed value.
2. Start at the last index of the string.
3. Add that character to the initial string.
4. Decrement the index by 1.
5. Repeat 2-4 until reaching the first index.
6. Now you have a reversed string!
