### _HINTS_

Write a `commandSoldiers` and `pickUpNearestCoin` function to survive the attack!

Remember to call the functions you write inside your `while-true` loop.

For this level, the Two Flowers are connected to the peasant.

If the peasant is damaged, the Two Flowers will take damage and shrink instead of the peasant.

If the peasant is damaged and the Two Flowers are normal sized flowers, the peasant will take damage instead!

When the peasant isn't taking damage, the flowers will grow.

Use your knowledge of commanding units to fill out the `commandSoldiers` and `pickUpNearestCoin` functions.

**Remember to uncomment the function calls inside the loop when they're written!**
