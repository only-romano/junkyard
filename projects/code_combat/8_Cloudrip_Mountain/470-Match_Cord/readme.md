### _HINTS_

Ogres have prepared a minefield to protect their Cheiftain.

We can use the domino effect to our advantage to blow a match cord to the Cheftain!

You are given a map of the minefield as an array of strings. "x" is a mine while "." is an empty spot. All mines are 5 meters apart. When a mine blows, it will chain react with all mines adjacent to itself (horizontally and vertically but not diagonally.)

The first row of the map is the row closest to the hero, and the first column is the left edge.

When you find which one will get the Cheiftain, step on it and blow her sky high!
