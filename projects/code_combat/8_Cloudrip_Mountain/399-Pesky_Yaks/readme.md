### _HINTS_

The enemy's `type` is all scrambled!

Find all enemies that are **NOT** `"sand-yak"` and attack them.

Upon entering a clearing filled to the brim with yaks... You notice something isn't right... **it's an ambush!**

Remember that the Yak's type is `"sand-yak"`! Use this information to weed out those pesky yaks.
