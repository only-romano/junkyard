### _HINTS_

A Burl migration! The perfect time to acquire some information about the sizes of Burls!

Tell Senick, the Trapper the average size of this Burl migration.

Senick is on the hunt. He is searching for a Burleous Majorus! A fabled member of the Burl species whose size is unmatched! But, he has no idea where to start...

Help Senick conduct a little **field-research**. Find the average size of the Burl population, so it will become obvious when they stumble across a real Burelous Majorus.

The `average` is the `sum` `divided by` the **number of elements** counted. Written simply:

```javascript
var sum = 1 + 2 + 5 + 1;  // 4 elements!
var average = sum / 4;  // The average of these 4 elements is "2"!
```

Don't forget how to write a sum function for an array:

```javascript
function sumHealth(enemies) {
    // Start with a sum variable initialized to 0
    // Iterate over each element in the array
        // Add its health to the sum variable
    // Return the sum variable!
}
```
