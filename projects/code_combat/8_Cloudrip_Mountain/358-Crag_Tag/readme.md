### _HINTS_

![](img/crag_tag.png)

`move` is defferent from `moveXY`!

`move(pos)` has a single argument instead of `moveXY(x, y)`'s two arguments.

You can use it to move to a coin's position like `move(coin.pos)` instead of `moveXY(coin.pos.x, coin.pos.y)`.

Finally, `moveXY` moves until the destination is reached. `move` only moves a single step towards the target destination. Now you can do things inbetween movement commands!

This level shows the difference between the old `moveXY` movement and the new `move` movement.
