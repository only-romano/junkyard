### _HINTS_

![](img/mountain_mercenaries.png)

Use `summon` and `command` to protect yourself while gathering coins.

It's time to practice summoning and commanding soldiers!

The sample code shows you how to use `costOf` to check if you have enough gold to summon a soldier.

If you do, use `summon` to summon a `"soldier"`.

Then, use a `while` loop to loop through the array of `soldiers` and use `command` with `"attack"` to have your soldiers attack any enemies.

The sample code's comments show you how to do this.
