### _HINTS_

This is a big ogre. You might not be strong enough to attack it directly!

If you have trouble, let your archer ally attack while you lead the ogre away.

You can attack the `"Weak Door"` by name to free your ally, then help him fight the ogre `Two`.

When you attack something by name, be sure to include the quotes around the name (this is how you specify a String) and be sure to capitalize the names correctly.

Depending on your weapon and your strategy, you may have to attack the ogre more than once.
