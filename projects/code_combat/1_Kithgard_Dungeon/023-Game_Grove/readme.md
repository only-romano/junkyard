### _HINTS_

[Theory, methods and objects of Game Development at Code Combat](https://github.com/katitek/Code-Combat/tree/master/0_Review/000_gamedev)

Spawn a maze with:

```javascript
game.spawnMaze(1);
```

Change the number `1` to a different number, and you'll get different mazes. The maze for each number will always be the same!

Take a look at the sample code and Spawnables docs for new spawnable pieces you can use in your games!

This level shows off some fun new spawnables:

`"locked-chest"`s can only be opened with a key, like the `"silver-key"`

`"fire-spewer"`s shoot fireballs to the left and right.
