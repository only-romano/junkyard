### _HINTS_

Comments are a way for a programmer to explain their code to another programmer.

In CodeCombat, comments are helpful hints on what to write and how to structure your code!

```javascript
// comment in javaScript - read them for instructions.
```
```python
# comment in python
```

#### _Say/Speaking_

The `hero` always has access to the `say` method. This creates a speech bubble above the `hero`'s head saying whatever is inside.

In certain levels this is a requirement! But it can be a useful debugging tool.

```python
hero.say("Let me out!")
hero.say("Kazaam!")
hero.say("I'm here now.")
```
