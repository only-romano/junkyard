### _HINTS_

When you move, you only move as far as the next movement square (look for the small tiles on the ground).

If you don't know the name of ogres, you can use the `findNearestEnemy` method from your glasses to store references to the ogres in variables. When you call the `findNearestEnemy` method, you **must store the result in a variable**, like `enemy2` (you can name it whatever you want). The variable will remember what the nearest enemy **was** when you called the `findNearestEnemy` method, so make sure to call it when you see a nearby enemy.
