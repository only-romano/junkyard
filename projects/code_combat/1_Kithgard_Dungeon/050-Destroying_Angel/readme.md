### _HINTS_

Sometimes, you need to fuel up before a big challenge. There's not much carb-loading to be done in a dungeon, but legend has it that the certain types of mushroom can produce interesting... side-effects.

And then there's one kind of mushroom that temporarily makes you gigantic and strong. Probably want to eat that one.
