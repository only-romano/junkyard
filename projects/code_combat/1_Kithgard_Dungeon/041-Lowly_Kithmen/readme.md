### _HINTS_

They say that you need great armor for the forest world.

Because you don't know the names of these ogres, you can use the `findNearestEnemy` method from your glasses to store references to the ogres in variables.

When you call the `findNearestEnemy` method, you **must store the result in a variable**, like `enemy2` (you can name it whatever you want). The variable will remember what the nearest enemy **was** when you called the `findNearestEnemy` method, so make sure to call it when you see a nearby enemy.

Remember: when you use quotes, like `"Kratt"`, you are making a **string**. When you don't use quotes, like `enemy1`, you are referencing the `enemy1` **variable**.
