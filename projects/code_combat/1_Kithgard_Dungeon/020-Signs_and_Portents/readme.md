### _HINTS_

Your allies will hold off the invasion while you bring the lightstone to Senick and Omarn at the right side of the map.

Your goal is to keep moving toward the right side of the map, while your allies fight waves of ogres.

If you look carefully, your allies will give you tips, and you may even witness them using some advanced weapons, magic, and code!

When you've reached the red X on the ground, that's where you should stop. The glow from the Lightstone will repel the skeletons.
