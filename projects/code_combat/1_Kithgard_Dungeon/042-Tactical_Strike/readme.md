### _HINTS_

Have a problem you can't solve? Google it!

Each ogre thrower should be defeated with one hit, but you probably can't withstand a frontal assault.

Be sneaky and approach the throwers from behind!

If you assign an `enemy1` variable, make sure to wait until that enemy is defeated before assigning an `enemy2` variable with `findNearestEnemy`, because otherwise `enemy2` will refer to the same enemy as `enemy1`.
