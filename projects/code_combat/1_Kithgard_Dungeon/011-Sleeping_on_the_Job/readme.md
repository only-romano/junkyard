### _HINTS_

Move through the corridor and defeat the ogres to access the gem.

Be sure to use `hero.attack("Name")` to defend yourself once the ogres awaken.

The `hero.attack()` method requires a single argument which should be a **"string"**.

The two ogres in this level are sleeping on the job, but will wake up once you get close enough to them!

Their names are `"Bas"` and `"Vera"` so use those strings to attack them!

```javascript
// Navigate through the corridor
// Attack an ogre named Bort:
hero.attack("Bort");
// Remember to attack all munchkins twice!
```
