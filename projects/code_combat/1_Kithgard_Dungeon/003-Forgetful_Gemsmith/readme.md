### _HINTS_

Collect the gems by using your move commands!

```javascript
hero.moveDown();
hero.moveRight();
```

___

This one takes several commands, so make sure to use the autocomplete to write your code faster. You can type `r`, Enter to autocomplete a `moveRight()` command.

After you're done practicing simple movement with this level, it's time to learn `attack`-ing, so keep trying!
