### _HINTS_

![](img/true_names.jpeg)

Be sure to attack each ogre twice.

Capitalization is important!

Keep in mind a few things to beat this level:
1. You need to attack each ogre munchkin `twice` to defeat it.
2. Spell the names properly, with capitalization! `"Brak"` and `"Treg"`.
3. Put the names in quotes to make them into strings. Strings are a type of programming data. They represent text.
4. After you defeat `"Brak"` you should `moveRight()` to get the gem.
5. Then, defeat `"Treg"` by attacking them twice.
6. It's no problem if you die; you can always keep trying.
