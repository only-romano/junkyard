### _HINTS_

![](img/rich_forage.jpeg)

Combine everything you know to venture through the groves! Remember `while-true` loops, `if/else`, `flags`, `cleave()`, `attack()`, `pos` and `moveXY()`.

Combine everything you know about if/else, using flags, your special abilities, and accessing x and y coordinates from `pos` objects to clear all the meadows of coins and enemies.

You'll need to use `pickUpFlag` to move your hero between meadows, `attack` and `cleave` to defeat enemies, and `moveXY` to move to the position of coin items that you see.

_**Tip**: remember that you need to press Submit before you can place flags. The layouts are randomized, so they'll change each time._
