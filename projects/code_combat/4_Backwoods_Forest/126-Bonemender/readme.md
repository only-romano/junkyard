### _HINTS_

Wizards can choose between three types of spellbook: the Unholy Tome, the Elemental Codex, and the Book of Life. Each book gets more spells as you buy more powerful editions.

In this level, use the Book of Life's `"regen"` spell to regenerate allied soldiers as they withstand ogre attacks.

`"Chandra"` and `"Bernard"` will come within ten meters of you if they need regeneration, so check the distance to both soldiers and regenerate them if they are nearby. You can use `"Bernard"`'s example to fill in `"Chandra"`'s distance check and regeneration.

Make sure to attack enemies when you are not casting `"regen"`.
