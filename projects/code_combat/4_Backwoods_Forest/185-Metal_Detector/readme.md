### _HINTS_

That ogre camp is well guarded, but we can reduce the ogre numbers. We hid the artillery in the forest and prepared gold coins. Our plan is simple: a coin appears, an ogre runs for the coin, we shoot at the coin, done.

You task is to work as a rangefinder. Wait for a coin and then `say` the `distanceTo()` the coin.

You've learned about functions with `return` in the previous levels. Now it's the time to prove your knowledge! Complete the function and don't forget `return` in it.

To get the distance to an item use glasses method `hero.distanceTo(item)`. You function should return `0` (zero) if there isn't a coin.
