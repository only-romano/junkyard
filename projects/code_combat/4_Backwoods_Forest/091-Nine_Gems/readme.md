### _HINTS_

Programming is about more than just learning special commands. It's also about solving puzzles!

In this puzzle, use `moveXY` to move. That's the easy part! You need to collect all nine gems, but you can't use more than 4 `moveXY` commands.

**Hint №1:** _There is more than one solution. Think outside the box!_

**Hint №2:** _The first move (of one possible solution) is `hero.moveXY(32, 48)`. The next hint gives away a big clue, so you might want to go back and try again before you read it!_

**Hint №3:** _The second move is `hero.moveXY(70, 48)`. After trying this, you'll see the trick to the puzzle! But if you still need help... there are more hints._

**Hint №4:** _The third move is `hero.moveXY(31, 10)`._

**Hint №5:**  _The final move is... well, I think you can take it from here! Remember, when you get stuck on a difficult problem, check your assumptions!_
