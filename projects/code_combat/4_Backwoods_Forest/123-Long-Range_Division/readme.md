### _HINTS_

The ogres have taken a hostage!

Use **division** to calculate the range to each minefield, then `say` the range to fire an artillery shell and destroy the mines!

The ogres have a hostage, and have set up two minefields. You can't fire your artillery at the ogres, or the hostage will be hurt too!

You can use **division** to calculate the range to each minefield.

Division is done with the `/` operator like:

```python
4 / 2 == 2
6 / 2 == 3
7 / 5 == 1.4
```

The minefields' range are `distanceToEnemy / 3` and `distanceToEnemy / 1.5`

Just `say` the range after you've calculated it, and the artillery will fire at that range.

_Hint:  Leave the motivational `say` messages in your code, or you might get ahead of yourself and run into the artillery's line of fire!_
