### _HINTS_

![](img/signal_corpse.jpeg)

Use different colored flags to tell your hero to run away or `cleave()`.

Previously, you used `distanceTo` to attack only nearby enemies, and you used flags to move closer.

Now, we'll do the same thing, but we use a `"green"` flag to move toward (or run away from!) enemies and the `"black"` flag to tell our hero to use a 'cleave' attack.

This way, we can save the `cleave` attack for the right moment, when there are many enemies nearby.

_**Tip**: use `cleave` with no arguments to cleave where you're standing, instead of chasing an enemy to cleave._
