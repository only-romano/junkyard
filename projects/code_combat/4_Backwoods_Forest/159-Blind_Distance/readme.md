### _HINTS_

![](img/blind_distance.jpeg)

That village is too quiet. Looks like it's an ambush. The blind wizard is your only friend, but he is a really powerful mage. You will be the spotter for him. Watch for ogres and say the distance for any incoming. The wizard's powers are limited, use them **only when see an ogre**.

Use the predefined function that finds the nearest enemy and returns the distance to it (or 0 if no enemy). You can use function result in your code if you store it in a variable.

```javascript
var enemy = hero.findNearestEnemy();
```
