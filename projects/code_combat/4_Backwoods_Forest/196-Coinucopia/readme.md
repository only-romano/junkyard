Read the sample code in this level to understand how flags work, then press Submit and start placing flags where the coins are. You'll have to be quick to get 20 gold in 40 seconds.

The flag buttons will show up in the lower left after you press Submit.

Copper coins are worth 1 gold, silver coins are worth 2 gold, and gold coins are worth 3 gold.
