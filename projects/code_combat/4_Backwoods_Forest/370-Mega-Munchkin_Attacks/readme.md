### _HINTS_

Since your archer is much faster than the Mega-Munchkin, you can have her **kite** him: running ahead of him and shooting him, always staying within your archer's attack range and outside of the munchkin's attack range.

Try comparing the distance between your archer and the munchkin. If it's too close, run towards the corner. Otherwise, shoot.
