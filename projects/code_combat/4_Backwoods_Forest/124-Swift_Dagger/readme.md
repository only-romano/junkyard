### _HINTS_

![](img/dagger.jpg)

With your upgraded glasses, you can use `distanceTo` to measure the distance, in meters, to a target unit or position. In this level, you'll use that to throw your dagger at munchkins that come within throw range.

You'll need to use the **less-than** operator `<`.

You can read it like this: _if_ the distance is _less than_ your `throwRange`, _then_ throw your dagger at the enemy, _else_ attack the enemy with your bow.

Hover over the `throw` docs to see how to use your thrown dagger attack. The dagger has a short `throwRange` of 15m, so you only want to use it when the enemies are very close.

If you get stuck, try doing Peasant Protection and Munchkin Swarm to apply what you learned.
