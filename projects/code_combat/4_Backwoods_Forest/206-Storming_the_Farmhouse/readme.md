### _HINTS_

![](img/storming_the_farmhouse.jpeg)

Use flags to defend each entrance to the house. Use `cleave()` when you can to clear out masses of enemies.

On this level, you need to survive and protect the peasants. Use flags to maneuver your hero (remember you need to press Submit to use flags).

If you're having trouble, try using area attacks like Cleave when a large mob of ogres attacks.
