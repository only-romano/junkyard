### _HINTS_

Use explosive charges to demolish the gates and escape the dungeon!

##### Tips:
+ Building a `"fire-trap"` is like building a fence, but use the exact string `"fire-trap"` instead of `"fence"`.
+ You can hover over the map to find coordinates for your `buildXY` skill.

1. Use `buildXY` to put `"fire-trap"`s on `(35, 35)` and `(35, 29)`.
2. Use `moveLeft` to move back to the left so you don't blow up.
3. When the gate is destroyed, use `moveRight` again to move outside into the forest.

> You're free! Smell ya later, Kithgard!
