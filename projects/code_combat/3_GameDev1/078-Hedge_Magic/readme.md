### _HINTS_

Spawn a maze with:

```javascript
game.spawnMaze("forest", 1);
```

Change the number `1` to a different number, and you'll get different nazes.

The maze for each number will always be the same!

If you change `"forest"` for any other type of spawnables, then ... you'll see. Have a fun!
