### _HINTS_

You can change a unit's behavior by setting its `behavior` property.

`skeleton3.behavior = "Scampers"` will make the skeleton stored in the `skeleton3` variable move around randomly.

`skeleton3.behavior = "AttacksNearest"` will attack the nearest enemy.

`skeleton3.behavior = "Defends"` will attack only if an enemy comes close.

`skeleton3.behavior = "RunsAway"` will make the unit run away from the player.

Make sure to pick the right variable, like `skeleton3`, `ogre2`, `ogre3` or `archer1`!
