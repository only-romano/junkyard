### _HINTS_

Now with even more skeletons!

This time you need to knock over all the blue skeletons without knocking over any red ones. As usual, the ball instantly returns to the middle cross after hitting a skeleton. The peasant cannot go outside the box of flowers, but she can push the ball out. Make her push the ball from the right angle to make it go in the right direction.

Try using Vectors to line up your shots.

_**Tip**: check for a `ball.velocity.magnitude()` of `0` to see if the ball has reset to the center._
