### _HINTS_

This is an advanced level and you can solve it as you want without our instructions.

Peasants have built a good minefield. Even tiny ogres can't pass it. Only one little problem. You are IN the minefield.

Luckily it isn't an ideal minefield and there is a way to escape. Cross the marked line to escape.
