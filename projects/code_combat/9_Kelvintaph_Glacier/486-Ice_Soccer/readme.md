### _HINTS_

_"I think foosball is a combination of soccer and shish kabobs." - Mitch Hedberg_


Is it soccer? Is it ice hockey? Is it basically a flaming beachball on ice? What are those skeletons for?

Yes, yes, yes, and SKELETONS!

You need to score three goals before the ogres score three goals. You might be able to do it by coding your players' movement logic to intercept the ball and shoot it forward, but the main idea of this level is that you can use flags and your built-in human trajectory calculation skills to score.

Try this: whenever you place a flag, have your closest peasant move to the flag. If she is close enough to the flag, use the new `removeFlag` method to remove it.

You may need to try several times to get the hang of it, but as Kelvintaph fans always say, "Well... at least the game ends quickly."
