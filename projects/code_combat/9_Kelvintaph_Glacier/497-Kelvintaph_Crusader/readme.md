### _HINTS_

_One does not simply walk into Kelvintaph._

This level is the first of a challenge of difficult combat strategy puzzles. Your hero must defeat a group of brawlers and catapults on the south corridor and then escape to the bottom right.

Meanwhile, you must command your elite squad to defeat an elite ogre squad in the north corridor, then navigate to the top right exit without being suckered in by the deadly smooth ice or the giant bear trap.

If you can micromanage the battle above well enough to avoid losing any allies, you'll win the bonus objective. Think carefully about how each unit can work together to support her squad. You'll probably need to iterate over both your findFriends array and one of your friends' findEnemies array.
