### _HINTS_

You must escape from the ice maz--... Wait, wait wait, I've said this all before.

This is the last time, but don't forget the goal of your adventure - the treasure.

Go through the maze, find the treasure, and return to the exit.

Step on the red cross mark to escape from the maze, but don't leave the treasure behind.

Some doors are fragile and will open by the sound of your steps.

Explore the maze, room by room, to find the chest full of gems.

This is a more complicated version for navigating mazes! Explore the rooms using `isPathClear` and keep track of which rooms you've entered to ensure no doubling-back.
