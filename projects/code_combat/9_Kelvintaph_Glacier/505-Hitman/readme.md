### _HINTS_

You should defeat the Ogre Witch and you'd better do it **with one hit**. **Nobody should see you! (or hit you accidentally)**

Phase shift make your hero invisible and incorporeal. You can move through mines, units and projectiles while phase shifted.

P.S.: Use `backstab` or a powerful weapon against the witch.

___

Ritic has the unique ability -- Phase Shift. It allows him to move as a shadow. While Ritic is phase shifted he can move through any units and projectiles. Also, he is invisible for enemies in this state. And one more bonus: he gets the speed bonus.

With that ability, you can sneak into the heart of the ogre camp. Use obstacles to hide from ogres, while `"phase-shift"` isn't ready.

Be sure that you can defeat the Witch with one hit. You can use `backstab` weapon while your hero is phase shifted. Or use a powerful rifle, for example.
