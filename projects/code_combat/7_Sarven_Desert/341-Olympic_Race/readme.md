### _HINTS_

Your pet has entered a race!

The pet should **ONLY** run when the **referee** says `"Start"`. Do not listen to the other units!

Your pet is a participant in a race. Wait for the referee (a wizard) to say the command `"Start"`, then run to the red mark and return, crossing the finish line. **Avoid false starts**, run only after the command. Don't listen to the fans, only the wizard.

To get the information about who was speaking and what was said use the event handler parameter `event` and its properties: `event.speaker` and `event.message`.

If you have the problem with the current level try returning to previous levels and refresh your skills.
