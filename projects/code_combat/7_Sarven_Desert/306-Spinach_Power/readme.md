### _HINTS_

Drinking spinach potions can make you stronger, but too many will make you sick.

Collect **no more than 7 potions**, then defeat the giant ogres.

Use a `while`-loop with a condition that checks how many potions you have collected.

To collect `7` potions, you need to have your loop to run while `potionCount` is less than `7`.

A common error is to loop while `potionCount` is less than or equal to 7, but that will result in `8` potions being collected.
