### _HINTS_

This is a difficult and OPTIONAL challenge level!

Move to the right, fighting skeletons and avoiding yaks, to find the lair of the Skeleton King!

P.S.: Don't forget to use **Submit** button to play this level.

In this epic quest level, you need to roam to the right, defeating several bands of skeletons each time you discover a new area. To go to a new area, defeat all the skeleton groups in the area and then move to the very right edge of the screen.

Once you have ventured deep enough into the skeleton territory, you'll discover the lair of the Skeleton King, who holds the village elder's son in his bony claws. He is invincible until you have defeated enough waves of his minions to convince him to fight you himself.

One way to do the level would be to use flags to move between fights, angle towards and away from enemies, avoid fire traps, and confront the boss. You could also do it with clever movement commandsâ€“but keep in mind the level terrain is randomized in middle skeleton territory, so don't count on things staying where they were between attempts!

If you aren't discovering a new territory, make sure you've defeated at least three bands of skeletons and that you are standing on the very right edge of the map after your raven guide tells you to keep going.

_Go east, young hero, and blow up with the skeletons._
