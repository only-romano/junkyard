### _HINTS_

The hot sun is draining the hero's health! Conserve your strength! 

Only attack if `enemy.team` is `"ogres"` and `enemy.type` is `"skeleton"`.

Don't collect any items unless `item.type` is `"potion"` and `hero.health` is _less than_ `hero.maxHealth / 4`.

The cursed graveyard is a dangerous place to be!

Make sure to check the type of the skeleton so that the hero dosen't attack any yaks. Also make sure to attack only the skeletons on the `"ogres"` team.

Do the same for the items. Only grab the potion if the hero's health is less than `hero.maxHealth / 4`.
