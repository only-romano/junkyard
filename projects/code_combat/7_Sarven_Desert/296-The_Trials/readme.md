You must to free the paladin. To do it you need three keys.

Use your pet to get those keys. Don't try to collect them with your hero.

You've got skills required for this level in recent levels. If you have problems with this level try to return and resharpen your skills.

Be careful with item types and typos. Item types are **strings**.

Just to remind you:

```javascript
var potion = pet.findNearestByType("potion");
pet.fetch(potion);
```
