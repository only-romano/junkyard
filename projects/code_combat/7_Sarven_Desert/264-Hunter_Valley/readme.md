### _HINTS_

![](img/valley.jpg)

You are in the wrong place at the wrong time. You need to escape before yaks appear.

Use the route from the hunter and relative position functions to move out here.

Do you remember old methods like `moveLeft` from the Dungeon? In this level you will create your own flexible and improved functions.

Use the sample code for 'moveDownRight' as an example to complete the `moveUpRight` function.
