### _HINTS_

The hero's and cheiftain's army will get reinforcements while you wait.

Write a `sum()` function to find the total health of an array of units.

Wait until your soldiers have more total `health` than the ogres' total `health`, then attack!

Don't dawdle too long, or your soldiers will lose faith in this battle.
