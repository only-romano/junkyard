### _HINTS_

In order to disable the line of fire traps, you'll need to add the smallest and largest `value` from the traps together and tell Kitty the cougar. Kitty is a clairvoyant, force-telepathic, trap-disarming savant, so all you need to do is figure out the right sum and she'll do the rest. Make sure you're standing on the white X so that she can hear you.

To find the lowest and highest values, you could try iterating over a traps array returned from `findHazards` or `findByType("fire-trap")` while keeping a minimum value or a maximum value. There are a few other ways to do it, too. Good luck!

Once the traps are disarmed, get to the red X by the tent in the upper right. Feel free to either fight your way through the canyon or just make a break for it.
