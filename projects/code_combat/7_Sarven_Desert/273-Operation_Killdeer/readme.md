### _HINTS_

That is a big band of ogres!

Use a function with a boolean return value to check if the hero should retreat.

Fight until `shouldRun()` returns TRUE, then run!

These ogres are wicked smart. They won't chase a hero if `hero.health` is greater than one half of `hero.maxHealth`.

But, if your hero is seriously injured, they might think your retreating is real.

Fight until your health is low enough, then run to the red x-mark.

The `shouldRun()` function will check if you are healthy enough to keep battling. 

Use the return value inside of an `if`-statement's conditional to see if the hero should keep fighting or retreat.
