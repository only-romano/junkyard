### _HINTS_

Remember the simpler times, back in Kithgard Dungeon when you were running for your life with nothing but a pair of Simple Boots?

Well, this time you don't even have the boots!

You'll need to enchant your own boots with `moveRight`, `moveUp` and `moveDown` **functions**!

___

Functions are an important part of coding.

You've been using functions all along: any time you write code like:

```javascript
hero.attack(enemy);
```
+ you are **calling** (or **invoking**) a function called `attack`.

The actual code that gets executed when you call `attack` is long and complex. Imagine if you had to write 25 lines of code in your program each time you wanted to swing your sword!

That's the first benefit of functions: they reduce a whole bunch of code down into one line. 

Not only does this save you from having to re-type the same code over and over, it also makes your code easier to understand, because it takes what might really be complicated logic ("Ok so I want to attack. Do I have a weapon? Am I close enough to hit with my weapon? How long does it take to use my weapon? Do I hit? Do I cause damage?"), and makes it an easy to understand idea: `attack`.

Now you will not only be calling functions, you will **define** your own functions!

Defining a function has two parts: the **name** and the **body**.

The name is the thing you will use to call the function later, like `attack`.

The body is the code that will be executed when the function is called.

There are also sometimes **arguments** (like the `attack(enemy)`) but we will get into that in future levels.
