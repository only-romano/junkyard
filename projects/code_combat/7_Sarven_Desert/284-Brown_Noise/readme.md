### _HINTS_

You need to get the treasure chest and escape from the dungeon. Be careful with the skeletons, they are really powerful and can regenerate.

Use the **Brown Rat**'s ability `distractionNoise` to distract guards. It allows your hero to sneak and help your hero to sneak by skeletons.

P.S.: You can defeat skeletons only by one powerful hit.

The Brown Rat can distract enemies with the unique ability `pet.distractionNoise()`. Place the pet to the required position, use the ability and enemies (as allies) will move to the noise point.

The distraction time and range are short, so use it carefully. Also, you can use it in combat to get few seconds to retreat, heal or use `backstab`.
