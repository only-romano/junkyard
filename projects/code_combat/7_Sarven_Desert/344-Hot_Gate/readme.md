### _HINTS_

Use the artillery to protect the village. Your pet should say `"Left`" or `"Right"` to direct the cannons.

There is one problem with fast ogre scouts. But we have the `coldBlast` ability for that!

The Polar Bear Cub has the unique ability: The Cold Blast. It freezes enemies around the pet for few seconds.

It can give you some time to retreat or to use area damage ability.
